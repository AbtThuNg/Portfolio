	<h1>CASE STUDY: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?</h1>

    <h3>1. About the company</h3>
<p>Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. 
Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. 
Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.</p>

    <h3>2. Business Task</h3>
<p> As a data analyst, you have been asked to analyze smart devices in order to gain insight into trends of how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices.   
By using discovered trends to support guiding future marketing strategies. These findings and the high-level recommendations will help to unlock new growth opportunities for the company, and are presented to the Bellabeat executive team.</p>

 <h3>3. Analysis Introduction</h3>
<p>To analyze this project, I use <b>Google BigQuery</b> and <b>Tableau</b> to clean, transform, and visualize data insights that I gained.</p>
<p>Data source: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit">Fitbit Dataset</a></p>
<p><b>(*) Some Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Upload files:</b> Some issues when uploading data to Google BigQuery. The error message: <i>Could not parse ‘4/12/2016 12:00:00AM’ as TIMESTAMP for field ActivityHour (position 1) starting at location 27 with message ‘Invalid time zone: AM’.</i>
        The solution is to uncheck <b>Auto-detect Schema</b>, and choose Edit as text with the following query (example for steps_hours.csv file) and in Advanced options, type 1 at Header Rows to Skip. Repeat the same steps with other files.

    <li>
        <b>Checking Data consistency:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>METs_minutes: 33 unique users</li>
            <li>activities_day: 33 unique users</li>
            <li>calories_hours: 33 unique users</li>
            <li>heartrate_seconds: 14 unique users</li>
            <li>intensities_hours: 33 unique users</li>
            <li>sleeps_day: 24 unique users</li>
            <li>steps_hours: 33 unique users</li>
            <li>weight_day: 8 unique users</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>From the results, there are 24 unique users in the sleeps_day dataset, 14 unique users in the heartrate_seconds dataset, and only 8 unique users in the weight_day dataset, while other datasets have 33 unique users. Hence, with only 8 & 14 unique users, sleeps_day & heartrate_seconds are not significant to gain insights.</i></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Checking for NULL Values in all columns:</b> To make sure there is no null value for next analysis, we run this code (<i>Apply for all datasets that are related to the analysis</i>):

        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Process Phase - Google BigQuery</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Activities_day</b> dataset</li>
  <ul>
    <li>According to the reference from this article <a href="https://www.10000steps.org.au/articles/healthy-lifestyles/counting-steps/" target="_blank">(source: 10000steps)</a>, we classify the users as follows:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>- Sedentary: Less than 5000 steps a day.</li>
      <li>- Low active: Between 5000 and 9999 steps a day.</li>
      <li>- Fairly active: Between 10000 and 12500 steps a day.</li>
      <li>- Very active: More than 12500 steps a day.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>While other datasets have the date format ddmmyy, the activities_day has the yymmdd format, and we also insert the day_of_week column and week number.</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="images/2.png" alt="" width="800" height="550" />
  
  <li>Calculate the number of days per month (number_of_day_logged) that users logged in:</li>
  <p><b>Key finding:</b> The majority of users (21) logged in consistently for the entire month, indicating a highly engaged user segment. This high level of engagement suggests that a significant portion of users are committed to using the platform regularly.</p>
  <p><b>Challenge:</b> The users who logged in for only half of the month (< 15 days) might indicate a retention challenge. Understanding why some users stop using the platform after a short period can help improve retention strategies.</p>

</ul>

<li><b>Sleeps_day</b> dataset</li>
<ul>
  <li>Format Sleepday column</li>
  <li>Create columns hour_asleep & hour_inbed to convert the recorded minutes into hours.</li>
  <li>To gain insights from this dataset, I created a column named sleep_level to segment users by their asleep hours per day, with “sleep < 6 hours”, “sleep 6-8 hours”, “sleep > 8 hours”</li>
  <img src="images/6.png" alt="" width="600" height="350" />
</ul>

<li><b>Calories_hours</b> dataset</li>
<ul>
<li>Format ActivityDate column</li>
<li>Insert columns: day of week and week number</li>
<img src="images/7.png" alt="" width="600" height="350" />
</ul>

<li><b>Activities_day</b> dataset & <b>Sleeps_day</b> dataset </li>
<ul>
<p> To analyze the relationship between sleep and activity level of users, I created a joint table.</p>
<img src="images/8.png" alt="" width="600" height="350" />
</ul>

<li><b>Activities_day</b> dataset & <b>Calories_hours</b> dataset </li>
<ul>
<p> To analyze the relationship between Calories burned and activity level of users, I created a joint table.</p>

</ul>

<ul>
<h3>5. Interactive Dashboard in Tableau </h3>
<p> In this interactive dashboard, you have the flexibility to explore insights by filtering based on week number, day of the week, and activity level. This provides you with a comprehensive overview and allows you to recognize trends within the data easily.</p>
