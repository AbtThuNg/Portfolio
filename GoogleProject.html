	<h1>CASE STUDY: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?</h1>


<h3>1. About the company</h3>
<p>Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. 
Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. 
Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.</p>


<h3>2. Business Task</h3>
<p> As a data analyst, you have been asked to analyze smart devices in order to gain insight into trends of how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices.   
By using discovered trends to support guiding future marketing strategies. These findings and the high-level recommendations will help to unlock new growth opportunities for the company, and are presented to the Bellabeat executive team.</p>


<h3>3. Analysis Introduction</h3>
<p>To analyze this project, I use <b>Google BigQuery</b> and <b>Tableau</b> to clean, transform, and visualize data insights that I gained.</p>
<p>Data source: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit">Fitbit Dataset</a></p>
<p><b>(*) Some Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Upload files:</b> Some issues when uploading data to Google BigQuery. The error message: <i>Could not parse ‘4/12/2016 12:00:00AM’ as TIMESTAMP for field ActivityHour (position 1) starting at location 27 with message ‘Invalid time zone: AM’.</i>
        The solution is to uncheck <b>Auto-detect Schema</b>, and choose Edit as text with the following query (example for steps_hours.csv file) and in Advanced options, type 1 at Header Rows to Skip. Repeat the same steps with other files.

    <li>
        <b>Checking Data consistency:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>METs_minutes: 33 unique users</li>
            <li>activities_day: 33 unique users</li>
            <li>calories_hours: 33 unique users</li>
            <li>heartrate_seconds: 14 unique users</li>
            <li>intensities_hours: 33 unique users</li>
            <li>sleeps_day: 24 unique users</li>
            <li>steps_hours: 33 unique users</li>
            <li>weight_day: 8 unique users</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>From the results, there are 24 unique users in the sleeps_day dataset, 14 unique users in the heartrate_seconds dataset, and only 8 unique users in the weight_day dataset, while other datasets have 33 unique users. Hence, with only 8 & 14 unique users, sleeps_day & heartrate_seconds are not significant to gain insights.</i></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Checking for NULL Values in all columns:</b> To make sure there is no null value for next analysis, we run this code (<i>Apply for all datasets that are related to the analysis</i>):

</ul>


<h3>4. Process Phase - Google BigQuery</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Activities_day</b> dataset</li>
  <ul>
    <li>According to the reference from this article <a href="https://www.10000steps.org.au/articles/healthy-lifestyles/counting-steps/" target="_blank">(source: 10000steps)</a>, we classify the users as follows:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>- Sedentary: Less than 5000 steps a day.</li>
      <li>- Low active: Between 5000 and 9999 steps a day.</li>
      <li>- Fairly active: Between 10000 and 12500 steps a day.</li>
      <li>- Very active: More than 12500 steps a day.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>While other datasets have the date format ddmmyy, the activities_day has the yymmdd format, and we also insert the day_of_week column and week number.</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="images/2.png" alt="" width="800" height="550" />
  
  <li>Calculate the number of days per month (number_of_day_logged) that users logged in:</li>
  <p><b>Key finding:</b> The majority of users (21) logged in consistently for the entire month, indicating a highly engaged user segment. This high level of engagement suggests that a significant portion of users are committed to using the platform regularly.</p>
  <p><b>Challenge:</b> The users who logged in for only half of the month (< 15 days) might indicate a retention challenge. Understanding why some users stop using the platform after a short period can help improve retention strategies.</p>

  <img src="images/5.png" alt="" width="600" height="350" />
</ul>

<li><b>Sleeps_day</b> dataset</li>
<ul>
  <li>Format Sleepday column</li>
  <li>Create columns hour_asleep & hour_inbed to convert the recorded minutes into hours.</li>
  <li>To gain insights from this dataset, I created a column named sleep_level to segment users by their asleep hours per day, with “sleep < 6 hours”, “sleep 6-8 hours”, “sleep > 8 hours”</li>
  <img src="images/6.png" alt="" width="600" height="350" />
</ul>

<li><b>Calories_hours</b> dataset</li>
<ul>
<li>Format ActivityDate column</li>
<li>Insert columns: day of week and week number</li>
<img src="images/7.png" alt="" width="600" height="350" />
</ul>

<li><b>Activities_day</b> dataset & <b>Sleeps_day</b> dataset </li>
<ul>
<p> To analyze the relationship between sleep and activity level of users, I created a joint table.</p>
<img src="images/8.png" alt="" width="600" height="350" />
</ul>

<li><b>Activities_day</b> dataset & <b>Calories_hours</b> dataset </li>
<ul>
<p> To analyze the relationship between Calories burned and activity level of users, I created a joint table.</p>

<h3>6. Key Findings & Challenges </h3>

<ul>
	<li> <p style="color: #FF0000;">Key Finding:</p> <p>The majority of users (21) logged in consistently for the entire month, indicating a highly engaged user segment. This high level of engagement suggests that a significant portion of users are committed to using the platform regularly.</li></p>
	<li><b>Challenge:</b> The users who logged in for only half of the month (< 15 days) might indicate a retention challenge. Understanding why some users stop using the platform after a short period can help improve retention strategies.</li>
	<li><b>Recommendation:</b> The users who logged in for only half of the month (< 15 days) might indicate a retention challenge. To improve retention, consider implementing a strategy that involves sending motivational notifications. BellaBeat can set monthly goals to encourage users to stay engaged and make it easier for them to achieve their goals. This approach can help retain users who might otherwise disengage from the platform.</li>

	<li> <p style="color: #FF0000;">Key Finding:</p> 
	<ul>
	<li>Users who take more steps tend to burn more calories, indicating a positive correlation between activity level and calorie expenditure. However, it's worth noting that there are cases where users take more steps but burn the same or fewer calories. This suggests that additional factors like the amount of time spent being active, the pace of activity, and the percentage of activity level also play a role in calorie burn.</li>
	<li>The chart "Calories Distribution Across Activity Levels" provides a clearer understanding of the relationship between activity levels and calorie expenditure. It reveals that individuals with higher activity levels, particularly those classified as "fairly active" and "very active," tend to burn significantly more calories than those with lower activity levels.</li></ul>
	<li><b>Challenge:</b> Interpreting Variances: One challenge is understanding the variations in calorie burn among users with similar step counts but different calorie expenditures. Identifying the specific factors contributing to these differences, such as activity intensity, duration, or user-specific characteristics, to maintain user engagement and motivate them over the long term.</li>
	<li><b>Recommendation:</b> Develop detailed user profiles that encompass a range of features to gain a deeper understanding of user behavior. By segmenting users based on their activity levels, activity intensity, duration, and other characteristics, we can tailor our marketing strategies to better suit their needs. For instance, for busy users, we can recommend incorporating fairly active and very active activities into their routines, as these activities are known to burn calories efficiently in shorter timeframes. This approach can help users achieve their fitness goals without feeling overwhelmed by lengthy workouts..</li>

	<li> <p style="color: #FF0000;">Key Finding:</p> 
	<ul>
	<li>Users exhibit varying activity levels throughout the week. Tuesday and Saturday appear to be the most popular days for physical activity, with approximately 2% of users categorized as "very active" and 1.25% as "fairly active" on these days. Conversely, Friday records lower activity levels, with 1.64% classified as "very active" and 1.03% as "fairly active."Some individuals might be preparing for their weekend plans or finishing up work tasks, which could result in reduced physical activity.</li>
	<li>Calorie expenditure peaks during two distinct time periods: from 12:00 to 14:00 and 17:00 to 19:00. These patterns suggest that users may be more inclined to engage in physical activities during these hours. The midday timeframe coincides with lunch breaks, providing an opportunity for exercise, while the late afternoon to early evening period aligns with post-work hours when users may be actively burning calories. Other hours of the day exhibit reduced calorie burn, likely indicating periods of rest, work/study, or sleep.</li></ul>
	<li><b>Challenge:</b>How to maintain or boost user engagement on less active days (e.g., Fridays) to ensure that users remain motivated to track and improve their physical activity levels consistently. In addition, understanding behavioral patterns: to idenfity the reasons of spikes in calorie burn during certain hours.</li>
	<li><b>Recommendation:</b> To address the challenge of user engagement on less active days, consider implementing targeted promotions or challenges. For example, Bellabeat can encourage users to set specific goals for Fridays, offering incentives such as discounts, virtual badges, or access to premium offers upon goal achievement. This approach can motivate users to stay active even on less active days.</li>

	<li> <p style="color: #FF0000;">Key Finding:</p> 
	<ul>
	<li>There is a strong positive correlation of 0.99 between the time users spend in bed and the time they actually sleep. In other words, the more time a user spends in bed, the more sleep they tend to get. Additionally, the majority of users typically sleep 6-8 hours.</li>
	<li><b>Challenge:</b>The challenge lies in understanding the factors that affect the quality of sleep within this time frame. Specifically, there's a need to explore why users spend an extended period in bed before falling asleep and how Bellabeat can help enhance sleep quality during that time.</li>
	<li><b>Recommendation:</b>To address this challenge, Bellabeat can introduce features and content in its app that aim to improve sleep quality during the time users spend in bed before falling asleep. This could include guided relaxation exercises, sleep-inducing audio contents or mediation content. By offering valuable tools and insights, Bellabeat can assist users in making the most of their time in bed and optimizing their sleep quality. At the same time, Bellabeat could leverage this fuction to encourage users brings Bella products during sleeping time.</li>
