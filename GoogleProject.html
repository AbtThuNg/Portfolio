	<h1>CASE STUDY: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?</h1>

    <h3>1. About the company</h3>
<p>Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. 
Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. 
Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.</p>

    <h3>2. Business Task</h3>
<p> As a data analyst, you have been asked to analyze smart devices in order to gain insight into trends of how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices.   
By using discovered trends to support guiding future marketing strategies. These findings and the high-level recommendations will help to unlock new growth opportunities for the company, and are presented to the Bellabeat executive team.</p>

    <h3>3. Analysis Introduction</h3>
<p>The phases of answering this work followed Google’s six Data Analysis steps: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.</p>

    <h2>Step 1 - ASK </h2>
<p> There are two key tasks in this phase:
- Identify the business task
- Consider key stakeholders
And these lead one deliverable: a clear statement of the business task.
